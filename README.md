# SmartScheduler.

Your classes, your job and the rest of your life on one calendar, and a plan for
exactly what to work on in every free gap.

Paste in calendar links from Canvas, Learning Suite, Google, Outlook or Apple.
SmartScheduler finds your classes and assignments on its own, works out when you are free,
and fills that time with the work that is due soonest.

No accounts, no database, no API keys, no environment variables. Anyone can open
it and start.

## Pages

- **`/`** — the home page for newcomers: what SmartScheduler does, how the plan is made,
  and where to find the calendar link in each app (Canvas, Learning Suite,
  Google, Outlook, Apple, scheduling apps), grouped by school, work and personal.
  It is rendered on the server, so it shows up at once and search engines can
  read it. Anyone who already has calendars in their browser skips it and goes
  straight to their plan.
- **`/about`** — the same home page, for people who already use SmartScheduler. It never
  skips ahead to the app; Settings → **About SmartScheduler** links to it.
- **`/design`** — the design library: every component the screens are built
  from, drawn live, with when to use it and why it exists. Code in
  [`src/components/ui`](src/components/ui); the screen-by-screen usability review
  is in [`DESIGN_REVIEW.md`](DESIGN_REVIEW.md).
- **`/app`** — SmartScheduler itself. `/app#demo` opens it with sample data, unless that
  browser already has calendars of its own.

## What it does

- **Plan** — the home screen, built to answer three questions at a glance:
  *what should I work on right now* (one task, with a Done button), *what does
  the rest of my day look like* (your events, and each stretch of free time
  with the work planned into it), and *what's due this week* (each item says
  when it's planned, or that it won't fit in time).
- **Calendar** — month, week and day. Week and day are time grids showing your
  classes, your personal events and your planned work side by side.
- **Upcoming** — everything due, by day, with where it sits in the plan.
- **Classes** — every class side by side in one board, like the days of the
  week view: when it meets, how much is left, and its work in due order.
  Classes are created automatically from your calendars; rename, recolour or
  hide any of them.
- **Class times** — class calendars list what's due, rarely when class is. Add
  each class's days and times once (during setup, in Settings, or from the
  prompt on the Plan screen) and they show on your calendar in the class's
  colour and block that time in the plan. Classes whose calendar already has
  meetings say so. Click any class on the calendar to change its time (a wrong
  time from Canvas is replaced by yours, and you can switch back), or to mark a
  single day off, like a holiday.
- **Change alerts** — each refresh is compared with the last. When a due date
  moves, or work is added or removed, the bell says so. Click to jump to it.
- **Your own tasks** — add work no calendar knows about with the + button.

## How the plan is made

Two steps, kept simple on purpose so you can always tell why it says what it says.

1. **Find the gaps.** Each day has working hours (8 AM–10 PM by default).
   Everything busy on your calendars, plus any weekly busy times you add, is cut
   out, class times included, with a little breathing room either side (10
   minutes by default). What's
   left, if it's at least 20 minutes long, is free time.
2. **Fill them, soonest deadline first.** Going through the gaps in order, each
   gets the most urgent unfinished work that fits. If the most urgent thing is
   too long for a short gap, the next thing that fits goes there instead, so
   short gaps still get used. Longer work is split across gaps in pieces of at
   least 25 minutes; quizzes are never split. Nothing is scheduled after its
   own due time, and there's a daily limit (4 hours by default) that only work
   due within a day can go past.

Every kind of work has a starting estimate (reading 30m, assignment 1h,
project 2h, exam 3h of study). Open any item to change how long it needs, which
is also how you tell SmartScheduler you are part-way through. Exams on a class calendar
automatically get a "Study for …" task before them.

The code is in [`src/lib/planner.ts`](src/lib/planner.ts), with tests in
[`src/lib/__tests__/planner.test.ts`](src/lib/__tests__/planner.test.ts).

## Adding calendars

Every calendar app can give you a private link to a calendar (called iCal, ICS or
webcal). SmartScheduler reads that link, so it always sees the latest version.

| Where | How to get the link | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Canvas** | Calendar → **Calendar Feed** (bottom of the right-hand column) | One link covers every class. Each assignment links back to Canvas. |
| **Learning Suite** | A course's Schedule → its calendar (iCal) link | One link per class. |
| **Google Calendar** | Settings → pick the calendar → Integrate calendar → **Secret address in iCal format** | School and work Google accounts sometimes have this switched off by an administrator. |
| **Outlook** | Outlook on the web → Settings → Calendar → Shared calendars → **Publish a calendar** → copy the ICS link | "Can view when I'm busy" is enough if you'd rather not share titles. |
| **Apple (iCloud)** | Calendar sharing → turn on **Public Calendar** → copy the link | Anyone with this link can read the calendar, so keep it to yourself. |
| **Anything else** | Any iCal, ICS or webcal link | Work rosters, sports schedules, clubs. |

Each calendar is either **School** (its entries become classes and assignments)
or **Personal** (its entries only mark you as busy and never turn into homework).
SmartScheduler picks one when you add a link and you can switch it at any time.

**Staying up to date.** These links are live. SmartScheduler re-reads every calendar when
you open it, when you come back to the tab, and every 30 minutes while it's open.
Google and Apple reflect changes within minutes; Outlook can take a few hours to
republish.

**If a link won't add,** the message says why and what to copy instead. The
common one: Google's "public address" only works for calendars shared with
everyone, so use the "Secret address in iCal format". Canvas can also label a
class with an unhelpful code like "All Sections"; SmartScheduler looks for the real code in
section names, and you can tap any class under its calendar to rename it.

**What a calendar link can't tell SmartScheduler.** Feeds say when work is due, not whether
you handed it in. When you first add a school calendar, anything already past due
is assumed done (you can untick it). After that, tick things off as you finish
them.

## Your data

- Calendar links, classes, done marks and settings are stored **in your browser**
  (localStorage). There are no accounts and no database.
- The server has one job: fetch a calendar link you send it, turn it into
  classes, work and busy time, and send that back. It stores nothing and logs
  nothing about the calendar.
- **Using more than one device:** Settings → *Copy setup link*. Opening that link
  on your phone or laptop brings your calendars, classes and choices across. The
  setup travels in the part of the URL after `#`, which browsers never send to a
  server. It contains your private calendar links, so only send it to yourself.

Because the server fetches any link it's given, it refuses links that point at
private or internal network addresses, checks every redirect, and caps the size
and time of each download (see [`src/lib/server/fetchFeed.ts`](src/lib/server/fetchFeed.ts)).

## Why not the Canvas API?

Canvas's API needs either a personal access token or a developer key issued by
each school. Canvas's API policy doesn't allow an app used by many people to ask
them for personal tokens, and developer keys have to be approved school by
school. The Canvas **Calendar Feed** needs neither and works at every school, so
SmartScheduler uses that. The trade-off is that SmartScheduler can't see whether something was
submitted, which is why you tick things off yourself.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000 (the app itself is at /app)
npm test           # parser, planner, workspace and timeline tests
npm run lint
```

No configuration is needed. Pick **Try it with sample data** on the home page to
see it working without any calendars.

## Testing the entry states (prototype)

SmartScheduler is currently styled as a **low-fidelity prototype**: greys and one accent
colour, a sketch font, square outlined boxes, and wireframe drawings of the app (`src/components/LandingSketches.tsx`) in place of pictures.
Every entry screen leads with the same sentence — *"See exactly what to work on
in every free gap of your day."* — and has one primary (accent) button. The
wireframe rules are at the end of `src/app/globals.css`; the shared pieces
(`PrototypeNotice`, `PrototypeBadge`, `CapabilityHero`, `WirePlaceholder`) are in
`src/components/Prototype.tsx`.

What the browser stores decides which state you see (all in localStorage):

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `prio:prototype-notice` | Set when the "early prototype" notice is dismissed. Missing = notice shows on the next page load. |
| `prio:goal-notice` | Set when the goal-setting pop-up is dismissed. Missing = goal shows right after the prototype notice. |
| `prio:tour` | Set when the Plan walkthrough is finished or skipped. |
| `prio:ws` | Calendars and choices. Calendars here + finished setup = returning user. |
| `prio:ui` | Includes `setupDone`, current view, and settings sub-panel. |

**Quickest way:** run `npm run dev`. A small **Dev: entry states** box sits in the
bottom-left corner with one-click shortcuts to each state below. It only exists
in development (`NODE_ENV=development`) and is not in production builds.

**By hand** (works in any build; a private/incognito window is a clean first visit):

| State | How to reach it | What to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| First visit, prototype then goal | New private window → `/` (or `/about`, `/app`, `/app#demo`) | Prototype notice first; after **Got it**, the goal pop-up appears with the 45-minute example. Neither returns on refresh once dismissed. **Prototype** and **Goal** tags reopen each. |
| Home `/` | Private window → `/` | Capability sentence is the biggest thing; **Start planning** is the only accent button. |
| About `/about` | `/about` (never redirects) | Same, with **Open SmartScheduler** as the primary button. |
| New user `/app` | Private window → `/app` | Onboarding: capability first; **Skip** on every step enters a usable Plan (sample data if no calendars yet). |
| Sample data `/app#demo` | Private window → `/app#demo` | Plan screen with the capability above the "Sample data" note; **Done** is primary. |
| Returning user `/app` | After the demo (or real calendars), open `/app` again, or `/` (redirects to `/app`) | Plan screen, capability first, **Done** primary; goal/prototype do not auto-interrupt. |

**Goal routes (same outcome: mark productive work done):**

1. **Plan** → open a free gap → choose a task → review / Why this task? → **Done**
2. **Calendar** (week/day) → open a free gap or planned-work block → review → **Done**
3. **Upcoming** or **Classes** → open a task → review → **Done**

Help (header) lists these routes. See [`SUBMISSION_NOTES.md`](SUBMISSION_NOTES.md) and [`SCREEN_INVENTORY.md`](SCREEN_INVENTORY.md).

To start over without a private window, run this in the browser console, then
reload: `Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith("prio:")).forEach(k => localStorage.removeItem(k))`.
Settings → Start over → **Remove everything** clears calendars and settings but keeps the theme and
the prototype-notice dismissal.

See [`FIVE_SECOND_TEST.md`](FIVE_SECOND_TEST.md) for the five-second test template.

`npm run dev` accepts links whose site resolves to a private network address
(common on campus Wi-Fi and VPNs). A production build refuses them unless started
with `FEED_ALLOW_PRIVATE_HOSTS=1`, which is only for testing on your own machine.
Never set it on a public deployment.
